# DATA SCIENCE 

# Deploying a Streamlit ML App

Have you ever encountered difficulties in making a good presentation? Python notebooks are not clear enough for a presentation?

In this project I developed a template for future presentations to stakeholders using **`Streamlit`**

The main goal is to improve your next presentations!

## Context

Making a presentation and properly communicating insights is often a challenge. 
As a solution, it is possible to deploy an app using python code in which it is possible to import a dataset and then perform 3 steps common to all analysis:

- `Exploratory Data analysis` (EDA)
- `Data visualization`
- `Machine Learning models` (prediction, classification, clustering)

## Dataset

As an example for the user and the demonstration we will use the dataset shown below.

It is important to note that the user can use his own dataset and import it in any format (CSV, XLSX, TXT, JSON).

[Dataset](https://github.com/fedeandresg/streamlit_data_app/blob/main/Bank_Personal_Loan_Modelling.csv)

## Deployment

The code developed in the [mlapp.py](https://github.com/fedeandresg/streamlit_data_app/blob/main/mlapp.py) file was developed using `Python` and was deployed using the `Streamlit` service.

Below is the link for testing:
